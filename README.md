# 🚦 Deadlock Detection & Recovery Simulator

This project is an interactive Operating System visualization tool designed to simulate **Deadlock Detection, Resource Allocation, and Recovery mechanisms**. It allows users to dynamically create processes and resources, visualize their relationships through a Wait-For Graph, and analyze safe or unsafe system states.

The simulator helps students and developers understand complex deadlock concepts using real-time graphical visualization and algorithm simulation.
